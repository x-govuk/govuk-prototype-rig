Like the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, the rig is built on the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework, and uses [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend).

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16

[Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended if you are working across multiple projects that use different versions of Node.js.

## Downloading the Prototype Rig

There are few different ways you can get the rig:

* [Download the Prototype Rig (zip)](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/govuk-prototype-rig/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

* [Visit the Prototype Rig GitHub repository](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/govuk-prototype-rig/) and click ‘Use this template’.

  This will create a copy of the repository rather than a fork. This means you can start your project will a single commit, rather than the Prototype Rig’s commit history. Learn more about [creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

* In the terminal, clone the Prototype Rig GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:paulrobertlloyd/govuk-prototype-rig.git
    ```

  Unlike using a template, this will include the commit history of the Prototype Rig.

## Installation

1. Open the directory you downloaded the rig to

2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

3. Start the application: `npm start`

4. Go to <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
